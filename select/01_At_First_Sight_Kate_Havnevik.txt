A sting through my heart
I'm anxious and breathless
I need to know more
Right now

I can't help myself
I'm such a failed bomb
You're making your way deep inside

(This must be)
At first sight, at first sight
So hold on tight, yes hold on tight
At first sight, at first sight
So baby hold on tight

Sirens go off
Blissful emergency
You can't calm me down
I'm alive

Here it comes
Here it comes

At first sight, at first sight
So hold on tight, yes hold on tight
At first sight, at first sight
So baby hold on tight

It doesn't compute
Impossible feelings are taking place
You're almost too close
I have no defenses
And it's beautiful

At first sight, at first sight
So hold on tight, yes hold on tight
At first sight, at first sight
So baby hold on tight
