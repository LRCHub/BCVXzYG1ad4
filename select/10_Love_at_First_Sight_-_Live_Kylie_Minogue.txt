Thought that I was going crazy
Just having one of those days yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came up and filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

Cuz baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

Started running out of love
Thinkin' 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came up and filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

Cuz baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one
(Meant to be as one)
Cuz baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came up and filled up the sky
The music you were playing really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight
Ooh love at first sight
Love
Ooh it was love it was love
At first sight

Cuz baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one (meant to be as one)

Cuz baby when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one (meant to be as one)

It was love it was love it was love it was love
Ooh, it was love it was love it was love it was love
Ooh...
